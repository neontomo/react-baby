- **CSS Styling:** Styling choices were made to ensure a visually appealing and cohesive design.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Custom JavaScript hooks were implemented to enable state management and dynamic updates.

## Optimizations

Throughout development, I focused on optimizing performance and usability. Some optimizations included:

- **Code Refactoring:** Refactored codebase for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensured compatibility with major browsers for a seamless user experience.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing React Baby provided valuable learning experiences and insights. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Custom Hook Implementation:** Learned how to create and utilize custom hooks for efficient state management.
- **DOM Manipulation Techniques:** Explored various DOM manipulation techniques for dynamic updates.
- **User Experience Considerations:** Considered user experience principles to create an intuitive and user-friendly library.
